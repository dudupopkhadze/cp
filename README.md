# CP

### While using devices with different os-es, sometimes you have to share links, messages, etc. between them. Doing this by hand or using slack thread with yourself to share these stuff can get annoying.

### This is a simple tool to help you with that.

### Run CP.server on your destination device and add CP.client to your path, so you can use it from anywhere. Or run both on multiple devices to allow bi-directional sharing.
